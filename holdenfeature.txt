The main feature I plan to add to our gameare random flying 'objects' such as our character.
I plan on making the branch name flying-obstacles.
I expect to update player if I need to implement a death scenario. Otherwise, I don't expect to update much more than PlayState.hx
I expect to create the class: FlyingObstacles.
It should inherit FlxSprite.

This new feature will basically be a different obstacle that the player will have to avoid. I have yet to decide if it will 'flap its wings'
like the player, or if it will fly in some random direction. If collisions occur with the player, the player will die.
